# SunClock

A basic world clock showing the time and sky color for 4 locations.

The clock can be configured using the config.json file next to the executable.
The locations are also defined in this file, use airport codes (IATA) and the program will use the stored latitude and longitude to determine the timezone and sun angles for the sky visualization.
